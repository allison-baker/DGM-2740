        There are many ways to volunteer with us, including becoming a bike collector in your area, joining a committee,
        or helping us clean and prepare bikes at our warehouse location.

        All levels of mechanical ability are welcome – including no experience at all! You will be assigned a station as
        a Cleaner, a Prepper, or a Mechanic. All supplies and instructions will be provided.

        Volunteering makes for a great group or corporate team building exercise! If you have between 10-15 volunteers
        and would like to schedule a private session, please email info@fb4kut.org and we’ll get you set up.
