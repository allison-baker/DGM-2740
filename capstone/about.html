      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Free Bikes 4 Kidz was founded by a group of community-minded cyclists in Minneapolis in 2008. That first year’s
        giveaway of 300 bikes was just the beginning. Since then, FB4K has given away more refurbished bikes annually
        than any other organization – over 60,000 bikes to date. In 2015, Free Bikes 4 Kidz Utah became the first
        affiliate outside Minnesota. FB4K organizations can now be found in eight states – and counting!
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Free Bikes 4 Kidz is a non-profit organization geared toward helping all kids ride into a happier, healthier
        childhood by providing bikes to those most in need. The public donates gently used bikes, we organize volunteers
        to clean and refurbish them, and then we give them away to kids in need.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Method</h2>
      <p>
        Every year 25 million bikes are sold in the US. One-third of those bikes are 20” wheel-size or smaller. Kids
        grow like weeds so millions of bikes are outgrown each year, and there are millions of kids that might not get a
        bike of their own. That’s where we come in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every October, we host a Collection Event where we take in as many bikes as we can get our hands on. These bikes
        are taken to a warehouse where our awesome volunteers work to clean and repair those bikes through October and
        November. Meanwhile, we partner with community organizations and other non-profits to identify qualified
        recipients. In early December, we invite these families to our Distribution Event where the kids get to pick out
        a bike and helmet all their own.
