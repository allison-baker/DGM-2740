      <h1>About</h1>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Free Bikes 4 Kidz was founded by a group of community-minded cyclists in Minneapolis in 2008. That first year’s
        giveaway of 300 bikes was just the beginning. Since then, FB4K has given away more refurbished bikes annually
        than any other organization – over 60,000 bikes to date. In 2015, Free Bikes 4 Kidz Utah became the first
        affiliate outside Minnesota. FB4K organizations can now be found in eight states – and counting!
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Free Bikes 4 Kidz is a non-profit organization geared toward helping all kids ride into a happier, healthier
        childhood by providing bikes to those most in need. The public donates gently used bikes, we organize volunteers
        to clean and refurbish them, and then we give them away to kids in need.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Method</h2>
      <p>
        Every year 25 million bikes are sold in the US. One-third of those bikes are 20” wheel-size or smaller. Kids
        grow like weeds so millions of bikes are outgrown each year, and there are millions of kids that might not get a
        bike of their own. That’s where we come in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every October, we host a Collection Event where we take in as many bikes as we can get our hands on. These bikes
        are taken to a warehouse where our awesome volunteers work to clean and repair those bikes through October and
        November. Meanwhile, we partner with community organizations and other non-profits to identify qualified
        recipients. In early December, we invite these families to our Distribution Event where the kids get to pick out
        a bike and helmet all their own.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Sponsors and Partners</h2>
      <p>
        Through the generous support from our partners like Nate Wade Subaru, Guthrie Bicycle, National Interscholastic
        Cycling Association (NICA), Robert J DeBry & Associates, Capital Broadcasting, QBP, Park Tool and many more, we
        can turn a lot of dusty bikes into shiny smiles! We still need support in building the foundation to help every
        kid ride into a more memorable childhood. To learn more about becoming a sponsor, please email
        nick@fb4kutah.org.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>How do I get a bike for my child or myself?</h3>
        <span>+</span><span>X</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Virtually all of our bikes are given away through a network of non-profits, community organizations, churches,
        and schools. The best way to get a bike is to contact one of these types of organizations in your neighborhood
        and ask if they are connected with FB4K. If not, ask them to consider getting involved with FB4K. Organizations
        can apply for bikes here.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>How do I donate a bike?</h3>
        <span>+</span><span>X</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Bikes can be dropped off at our Collection Events. Dates and locations can be found on our Donate a Bike page.
        Please consider donating $20 bucks in addition to your bike. That will just about cover the cost of a helmet and
        supplies for us to get your bike back in ‘good as new’ condition.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>What kind of bikes are you looking for?</h3>
        <span>+</span><span>X</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Free Bikes 4 Kidz is looking for new or gently used bikes of any size (including tricycles and scooters)—child
        or adult. We are looking for bikes that are in good rideable condition and need minimal work in order to get
        them looking and running well. We are not looking for bikes that are rusted, missing wheels, bent wheels, or
        basically in “tough” shape. We want to give away bikes that look good and are safe and fun to ride. Plus we do
        not have the time or resources to fix up severely damaged bikes.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Is FB4K a 501c3 non-profit? Can I contribute financially to FB4K and help get more bikes to kids?</h3>
        <span>+</span><span>X</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Yes. And yes. We are a registered non-profit so 100% of your contribution is tax deductible. (You will receive a
        receipt from us for all contributions.) We gladly accept contributions of any size. We spend somewhere in the
        neighborhood of $25 to get each bike in tip top shape, so your donation will help get more bikes to more kids.
        Visit our Financial Donations page where you will be able to make a donation online using your credit card. Or,
        if you would rather, you can send a check to our mailing address, also listed on our Contact page.

        <h3>I would like to volunteer my time to help. What can I do?</h3>
        <span>+</span><span>X</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        We literally need thousands of volunteers to clean, repair, and help us give away 5000+ bikes each year. We love
        people who have mad bike repair skills, but if you don’t have that ability, we still desperately need you. If
        you can wash and shine a bike, we need you. If you can, pump up tires we need you. If you can change tires and
        lube chains and hubs, we need you. If you can help us move, load, and unload bikes, we need you.<br /><br />Here’s
        what you do. Go to the Volunteer page and register. You can register as an individual, or you can register a
        whole group that you are bringing along with you. You can choose the location where you want to volunteer, the
        day, the time slot, and you can tell us what your skill level is. Then when you arrive on that day, we will be
        prepared to give you tasks that fit your skills. We generally have drinks and snacks available for our
        volunteers…plus we throw a huge party after the dust clears in December and ALL volunteers are invited—live
        music, food, dance, and fun!

        <h3>
          How does my non-profit, community organization, church, or school get on FB4K’s radar so that we can be
          recipients of bikes?

        <span>+</span><span>X</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        You can Apply 4 Bikes online and tell us about your organization—what you do, where you are located, your
        history, if you are a registered non-profit, etc. We will connect you with our Bike Recipient Coordinator, who
        is in charge of coordinating and facilitating this process.

        <h3>I would like to start a Free Bikes 4 Kidz chapter in my city. Can you help me do that?</h3>
        <span>+</span><span>X</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Great question. Yes…and no. We get asked this question all the time, and we are getting very close to making
        that a reality. Please stay in touch with Terry Esau (terry@FB4K.com) our Executive Director because we hope to
        launch FB4K nationally soon.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>
          I run a bike shop here in town. I love that you are getting more kids on bikes, but I’m concerned that FB4K is
          tapping into my business, just a bit.
        </h3>
        <span>+</span><span>X</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        First off, we at FB4K are huge fans of our local bike shops and we do all we can to promote you. We believe we
        are NOT stepping on your business stream at all because we only give bikes to those most in need. We believe we
        are creating future buyers for your shops. FYI, many local bike shops are already partnering with us—collecting
        bikes, having their mechanics repair them in their down time, and delivering them back to us to give away. We
        believe that if we could get all the bike shops in town working together on this, we would be creating an even
        more bike-friendly, bike-crazed community and would ensure future growth in the cycling industry.

      <p>
        Terry Esau (terry@FB4K.com) is our Executive Director and he would be happy to talk with you or connect you with
        others in the organization. We believe we have a great success story that has only just begun. Thanks for
        helping us spread the… “Good Wheel to All, and to All a Good Bike!”
