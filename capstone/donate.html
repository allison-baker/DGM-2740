      <h2>Help Grease the Wheels</h2>
      <p>
        You can get involved by donating a bike or contributing financially. We are also always looking for volunteers.
        Donate a bike, time, or money, and help kids "go places."

          <h3>Donate Time</h3>

          <p>
            We appreciate all the help we receive from members of our community, including the precious time put in by
            our volunteers.

          <h3>Donate Bikes</h3>

          <p>
            We'll take your donations of kids and adult bikes, but we find ourselves especially in need of smaller
            bikes, even tricycles.

          <h3>Donate Money</h3>

          <p>
            $30 will provide a bike, a helmet, and the opportunity for a child to experience the joy and freedom of
            riding and owning their own bike.

      <h2>Tax Deductions</h2>
      <p>
        All items donated to Free Bikes 4 Kidz are deductible for income tax purposes at their present fair market
        value. Internal Revenue Code places the responsibility for estimating the fair market value upon the donor
        rather than the agency receiving the gift. (Local office of the Internal Revenue advises that “Fair Market
        Value” is interpreted as that which a buyer is willing to pay and a seller is willing to accept.) Free Bikes 4
        Kidz does not provide any goods or services for any property contributed.
